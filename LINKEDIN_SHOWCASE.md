# Healthcare Compliance Document Server - LinkedIn Showcase Guide

## Project Overview

A **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that provides semantic search capabilities for healthcare regulatory documents and clinical guidelines. Built with Python, using local vector embeddings for privacy-compliant document retrieval.

## Key Features

- **Web Scraping**: Automatically extracts content from regulatory websites
- **Semantic Search**: Vector-based search using local sentence-transformers (no external APIs)
- **Document Indexing**: Persistent local storage with ChromaDB
- **Privacy-First**: All data stays on your machine - no external API calls for embeddings
- **Extensible**: Easy to configure for different jurisdictions and document sources

## Technical Stack

- **Python 3.13**
- **MCP Protocol** - Model Context Protocol for LLM integration
- **ChromaDB** - Local vector database
- **Sentence Transformers** - Local embedding model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- **BeautifulSoup4** - Web scraping
- **Asyncio** - Asynchronous processing

## Use Cases

### Healthcare & Pharma
- Quick reference for prescribing regulations
- Compliance checking during document preparation
- Training and education for healthcare professionals

### General Applications (Position as generic tool)
- Regulatory document search for any industry
- Clinical guideline reference system
- Standards and compliance documentation

## LinkedIn Post Ideas

### Option 1: Technical Focus
```
Just built an MCP server for healthcare compliance document search!

üîç Semantic search with local embeddings (privacy-first)
üìö Web scraping + vector indexing
üîí All data stays local - no external APIs

Built with Python, ChromaDB, and sentence-transformers. The MCP protocol makes it easy to integrate with Claude for natural language queries.

### Option 2: Problem-Solving Focus
```
Healthcare professionals need quick access to regulatory guidelines, but searching through hundreds of pages is time-consuming.

I built a solution: A semantic search server that:
‚úì Scrapes regulatory docs from official sources
‚úì Uses vector embeddings for intelligent search
‚úì Keeps all data local (HIPAA-friendly)
‚úì Integrates with AI assistants via MCP

Example: "What are the controlled drug prescribing requirements?" - instant, accurate results from official sources.

```

### Option 3: Learning Journey
```
Spent the weekend learning about Model Context Protocol (MCP) by building a real-world healthcare compliance tool.

What I learned:
‚Ä¢ Vector embeddings for semantic search
‚Ä¢ Building MCP servers in Python
‚Ä¢ Privacy-first AI architecture
‚Ä¢ Web scraping best practices

The result: A local-first document search system that healthcare pros can use for quick regulatory lookups.

Open to feedback and collaboration opportunities!

## Demo Screenshots to Include

1. **Architecture Diagram** - Show the flow: Web ‚Üí Scraper ‚Üí Embeddings ‚Üí ChromaDB ‚Üí MCP ‚Üí Claude
2. **Code Snippet** - Show the clean MCP tool definitions
3. **Example Query** - Screenshot of a search in action
4. **Configuration** - Show how easy it is to set up

## Positioning Tips

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Emphasize the **general applicability** (any regulatory docs)
- Highlight **privacy-first architecture**
- Show **technical skills** (Python, async, vector DBs)
- Mention **extensibility** to other domains

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Make it sound NZePS-specific
- Claim clinical decision-making capability
- Imply it replaces existing systems
- Over-promise on features

## Repository Description (if you open-source it)

```
A privacy-first MCP server for semantic search of healthcare regulatory documents.
Built with Python, ChromaDB, and local embeddings. Easily adaptable for any
regulatory framework or document set.
```

## Next Steps for Enhancement (Future Posts)

1. Add PDF parsing support
2. Implement citation extraction
3. Add multilingual support
4. Create Docker deployment
5. Build a simple web UI

Each enhancement = another LinkedIn post showing continuous learning!
